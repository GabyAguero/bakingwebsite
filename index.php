      Hi there!! Welcome to my website we hope you find what you are looking for.

      <p>Well, the foundation of this was initially based on only dreams and hopes.<br /> This dream later turned into a
        strong desire to undergo challenges inorder to put this business into action.
    It began with only teen messes in your parent's kitchen.<br />
    Ensuring that all your daily achievements at hand are delt with. For instance, your goal for the day; baking a lemon
    fudge cake,
    using all means posssible to get the job done. I think you can guess how that turned out. </p> 

    <p>Initially, I wanted this business to be an ice breaker to reflect all of the challenges I had faced,but due to
        the little start up capital
        I owned, I knew it wouldn't be the dream I had when I came up with the idea. My Dad invested a bit of cash into
        the start up of the business
        and yes I'm grateful but I never wanted to just get free help, so I've made my mark that when the business is
        all set to go, I shall save up money so that I can<br />
        pay back for all the help my Mum and Dad aided to me at the start of the tireless hustle. </p>

    <p>I never thought that it would take me this long to start up or even setup a website to accompany all my efforts
        and struggles. <br />
        When I look back at the times I used to say that I want to start up a business such that I can finally know the
        feeling of being able to <br />
        your hard owned cash, at the moment I'm actually smiling because I can finally set my mind to what I've always
        wanted to do. </p>

    <p>What I plan to do from here on out? , is a quetion that continuously runs about in my thoughts.<br />
        As of now, the answer is still I'm not so sure. Without farther waste of time this is my website and I hope it is a <br/> 
    benefactor to you.</p>
